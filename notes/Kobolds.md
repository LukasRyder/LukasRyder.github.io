# Kobolds

Freed from X by the party during session x

Most of the kobolds, under the rule of the shaman, decide to build a new settlement north of Emberhold, while the rest of them decide to go to the mainland through the teleportation circle. A small number of kobolds get along well with the townsfolk, and they decide to stay in the village.
