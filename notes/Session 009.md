# Session 009

Jar attaches his steam engine construction to one of the ships they plan to take to sea. He also fills his Bag of Holding to capacity with anything and everything he can, until the bag is nearly to the limit (450 of its 500lbs capacity). 

The group gathers their supplies and sets sail with Arcturis and a group of fishers, lumberjacks and guards, including one guard named Chaos who seems excited for the trip to be underway.

Their time at sea is calm, and they make camp for the evening. Finn searches for an animal to sacrifice to his deity, and encounters a herd of axebeaks. He manages to take one down as the rest flee toward the camp. Koda calms an axebeak through her animal friendship spell, and the axebeak becomes a temporary ally. The other members of the crew seem hesitant to share an already small boat with a very large, axe-headed bird. (Not to mention the smell).

The group worries about how Koda, their druid friend, will feel about Arcturis' suggestion to hunt a whale and use its blubber to muffle the effects of the crystal. They argue for a long time, eventually telling Koda and persuading her that one whale is an acceptable death for their requirements. 
Jar and Chaos take watch together in the evening, and Jar is more than happy to accept a new member to their group and dubs them no longer “The Squishy Squad”. During his watch, Morn notices a dark patch in the sky blocking out the stars. He wonders if it could be an approaching storm, or something else.

The following day, they all search for whales to no avail. Chaos tries to catch fish for bait while the fishers sit back and observe with some amusement.

During the next night of watches, Jar notices a flash of blue light over the crystal desert. When Morn and Finn take watch together, they discuss their deities. Finn is hesitant to share too much, but does share that the monks kicked him out of the order when he was a teenager.

As morning dawns, they find a pod of seals on the icy beach nearby. Chaos charges at them and tries to tackle one before they can dive into the ocean. Unfortunately, she is too slow, and slides across the ice on her belly with empty arms.
