# Spark

| Player: | Nathan |
| :----- | :----- |
| Character Name | Spark |
| Character Info: | NB / Automaton / War-forged Figther Cleric |
| First Session: | [Session 023](./Session 023.md) |

Owns a rust coloured [bag of tricks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/bag-of-tricks)

### Background
Made from wood and metal. Has a warhammer in a fire. Wears a skull from [Costaldo](./Costaldo.md) strapped to his backpack. Has a nozzle for food and drinks, and is smooth "downstairs".

Somewhere deep in the mountains, an old artificer spent his whole life dedicated to crafting intricate, beautiful artifacts and machinery. Not for profit or power, but for the worship of a god of creation [Gond](./Gond.md). At the end of this mastercraftsman's life, he was building something to continue his work. An automaton, but to create true life proved beyond his skill. Facing his own mortality and the end of his legacy, he prayed to this god for a miracle. An angel gave life to the automaton... and that's me! Warforged fighter/cleric multiclass.

Initially a defender of his maker and his temple, Spark protected them both until his maker died of old age and he has now ventured out to find a holy place where he can lay his maker's bones to rest. Along this religious pilgrimage he has grown closer to the god of creation he follows (picking up cleric levels). His maker's skull serves as his spellcasting focus. He's a bit preachy but ultimately a brave and noble servant of creation.
