# Session 007

The group examines the mural in the room beneath the defeated tree, but it doesn't seem particularly religious. Jar recognizes mechanical workings in the large beasts depicted, the design reminiscent of the structure inside the glacier they'd visited only a week ago. Algernon spots waning crescent moon imagery and decides to draw the mural while the rest move on from the room. 

Koda is the first to explore down the stairs, and the others follow using a Light spell to find their way. They find another room below with a black stone slab on the far end with tree roots grown and wrapped around it. The slab has been broken in many places, and is barely held together by the roots. The room itself is full of roots, and the group must carefully pick their way around them to reach a door. Inside this room they find four sarcophagi.

The group is nervous about the contents of the sarcophagi, and Finn carefully removes the treasures from within. Morn is uncomfortable with the grave robbing, and decides to stay in the other room. Jar smashes the skull of one of the skeletons--just in case. Finn comes away with various treasures, including an ivory wand, a ring, a necklace, a strange lantern, and of course a set of keys.

Meanwhile, Morn examines the black slab and discovers it consists of the same hard material as the sphere in the centre of Emberhold. He follows a black line of the same stone tracing from the slab, across the ground to the other side of the room toward a hidden door. They all find a a slot for the key Finn has and open the door. Inside is a larger sarcophagus. Koda touches it and is possessed. The door closes in and Jar and Koda are trapped inside. The ghost possessing Koda is upset to see the stone slab has been ruined by the tree roots. 

The group doesn't play to their strengths (ha) and try to strong-arm their way out of the closed doors. They use a sword and crowbar and eventually manage to fit through. Algernon finally arrives on the scene and is grasped by the ghost after it flew out of Koda, scared as it was by Jar's wielding of the strange lantern. Algernon ages five years, and runs to escape. Finn cuts at the tree roots and Koda transforms into a giant termite to assist. They get to the stone altar and destroy the roots holding it. 

The doors open again and they open the ghost's sarcophagus. Jar sticks around long enough to say "F*** you, ghost," before casting a firebolt to the skeleton's face and running out. Jar returns with a cry of "for Smushey!" and grab the apparently magical javelin inside the ghost's sarcophagus. 

Completely exhausted, and many of them terrified, they return to Emberhold. Jar constructs a shrine to Smushey, and they all get some rest in their respective lodgings.
