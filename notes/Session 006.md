# Session 006

The group fights a [moving tree](./Tree Of Dolls.md), and are zapped by a few angry wisps. After a hard-fought battle, and a tree nearly reduced to ashes, they catch their breath and spend some time examining the doll of [Smushey](./Smushey.md). [Algernon](./Algernon.md)’s arm is burnt when he manages to wrest another doll from the branches. This doll is much older than Smushey’s. The old man examines both, and finds the souls within them to have a strange, despairing pull. He’s too wise for that sort of nonsense, and shakes off the feeling.

The group discovers an entry below the tree and climbs (or jumps) down to discover an underground room. The walls depict floating cities and gargantuan animals as tall as mountains. Humanoids fight larger-than-life beasts and a figure stands in the clouds, raining lightning down on the battlefield. 

As they sit and contemplate the mural, the group takes a quick rest to recover from their fight.
