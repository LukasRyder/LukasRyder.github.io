# Session 010

The fishers are sent to go whaling while the rest of the group decide to release Koda’s axebeak friend (with some rations, of course) and head to the colossus. Morn helms their navigation through some ice chunks, and they soon arrive at the glacier. Fionnlagh is the first to climb up the ice wall, and the rest follow. Arcturis levitates up and Koda nearly kills the both of them when she tries to grab onto the wizard and float up with him. Arcturis is rather flustered by this encounter. 

They all reach the top, including Vyth on Jar’s shoulders. They notice the opening to the colossus is larger now, with giant claw marks in the ice and metal. It seems the gashes on the left are much thicker than the ones on the right, which are sharper and cleaner. Jar is nervous and emboldens the party with some temporary health.

They crawl down and have Arcturis levitate across to a hole in the ceiling. He and Jar create a somewhat rickety bridge and Chaos crawls across first to explore the room in the ceiling. Chaos sees a dome with a network of precious gems and metals in the ceiling and walls. The rest climb over, and Morn slips and nearly hits the crystal, but makes it through.

They inspect the room and notice some runes in giantish, but no one can read them. Koda tries to activate the dome but the power isn’t working correctly. They notice a rush of cold air and see a crack in the far wall leading back outside. Fionnlagh looks through and spots a nest of large eggs with a very old corpse used as part of the nest. He sees a shadow. A snowy owlbear appears and notices the monk, then charges. A second snowy owlbear appears and the party fights them off.

Fionnlagh accidentally shoots Koda with an arrow as she’s jumping through the fight as a craigcat. Arcturis hastens Morn, and Morn’s attacks are nearly fatal to one of the bears. Chaos manages to land both killing blows in the end. They all inspect the eggs and Koda decides to keep one. 

Arcturis seems especially shaken by the fight. He casts comprehend languages and discovers the dome is the control room for the colossus. Now, the party has a very large crystal to retrieve.
