# Session 025

Spark with his mirror and Vyth didn´t notice anything.
Fionnlagh hears scratching on the tent, he screams, waking up Jar, Kaos and the Kobolt Shaman.

[Kobolts sleep in nests, the hospital has elevated beds to make tending to the injured easier.]

Kaos sits up straight and readies her axe. Fionnlagh scrambles to put on pants, shoes and weapons. 
Jar also puts on pants, and readies the termal cube to release ... Spark slides down his pole with his hammer and shield and runs up to two kinda regular looking kobolts, but these have greyish matte scales instead of the red shine scales most of the kobolts in this village have. They have a lot of scars with a purplish glow. Spark says "stand down there doesn´t need to be any violence" and readies mindsliver in case of a agressive action.

One of the grey kobolts, rips the tent and jumps into the tent. Spark attacks with his mindsliver and Kaos attacks him with her axe. The kobolt bites Kaos in return.
Spark sees a hole in the fence where the poles are missing. He notices and thinks "I will repair that tomorrow".

Kaos misses her first attack, but hits on the second attack. The attacks doesn't seem to do as much damage as she expected. Fionnlagh lands three hits, but they don't do as much damage as he expected. The flesh seems to cave in under his blows. 

Jar exits the tent and uses his thermal cube to cast a flaming sphere, where the creatures take fire damage when they stay in place. Spark attacks and casts booming blade on his war hammer, so they get attacked by Lightning when they move. He notices that these creatures are undead in a way, but not the classic way of undead he knows.

One the creatures attacks Spark, he gets some bumps on his body, but not the corruption that these guys have. The other creature attacks Kaos. They both get a combo of necrotic and piercing damage.

Kall hits the grey kobolts with her walking stick. Kaos and Fionnlagh both attack again and Fionn's attack kills the grey kobolt in the tent.

Jar firebolts the grey kobolt outside the tent. Spark also hits that one and then gets attack from behind by yet another grey kobolt. Kaos stabs the grey kobolt with her lightning javelin. On her second attack she impales both of the grey kobolts with the lightning javelin. The first one falls of the weapon, death. Spark sees a sort of glitchy effect around the wound of the kobolt that dies.

Fionnlagh stunns one of the creatures. 

The sun is coming up. Jar dismisses his flaming sphere and then notices (also) the hole in the fence where he sees three eyes in the forrest, running really fast along the forrest, leaving North East away from the forrest. It runs on four or (possibly) more legs, it has a tail and his body is weirdly shaped with edges and bulges where you dont expect them. His three eyes are all in one skull and glow purplish.

Kall is checks all of the kobolts as Fionn ties up the stunned kobolt. These are part of the kobolts that were already missing before we arrived. The scars look like bite wounds. The skin is necroticly grey and the scales are soft. Kall seems to recognised them, but seems to be dissapointed. Kall explains she thinks the wounds are the cause of their behaviour. Jar casts cure wounds on the kobolt and that didn´t have an effect. Fionnlagh tries unsuccesfully to talk to the grey kobolt, Kaos hits it unconsious

Jar bets 3 silver Morn is already undead, Kaos bets 5 he is.

Kall is going to check the hospital, Fionnlagh goes to get his bow and arrow, Jar en Spark follow. Kaos stays with the unconsious grey kobolt.

in the hospital they see Morn sitting on the floor covered in blood. On one side the kobolts look okayish but still bad, no purple marks. On the other side lies a dead kobolt with the purple marks. Morn tells about a rough night. The injured kobolt jumped him after he came back from "doing his business". He had to kill them in self defense. Morn tells he cut out all of the wounds and infected flesh from the other kobolts. He points at one that died during that operation. The rest is probably spared. Morn tells how they decided to call it the Rot and gives credit to the kobolt medic.

Jar recognises Kras and talks to him. Kras tells about the Schredder.

Jar pays the five silver to Kaos and checks his fellow adventurers to see if they have the purple wounds.

Kall thanks Morn and comforts the other medic. Then she asks for the plan.
Kall agrees with burning the bodies, because that fits the ritual customs.

The tied up grey kobolt shrivvels up in the sun, and is dead-dead. Kaos throws up her hands and tells to everyone who wants to hear, she didnt do the kill.

Spark asks permission to test some types of damage on one of the dead kobolts. Fionnlagh tips him that he needs to keep the kobolt out of the sun. Spark tries to do something weird and complicated with a water shield. Jar helps with an actual shield. Spark notices a distinct lack of unpleasant smell. He tries radiant damage, and it works as expected on undead creatures. Spark brings back the body for the ritual burning.

Spark repairs the tent and does some light work and some arts and craft with the little kids, but the parents are really protective and he decides to walk away.

Jar, Kaos and Fionnlagh take a long rest. 

Morn wakes up from his nap and joins Kall for the ritual burning of the undead.

All of them sleep the entire day. When they wake up after eight hours it is 16:00.

Spark ask Kaos permission to enhance her axe for the day. She is conviced by sparkles.
Morn wakes up really quiet and wants to stay back at the village to help, but he kinda seems up for the day. Jar borrows back the spell restoring ring. Jar melts the blooded snow, where Morn washed his hands. Jar gives the ring to Spark.

Kall ask to accompany Jar, Kaos, Spark, Vyth and Fionnlagh on their quests. Jar and Kaos are tracking. Jar is in front with Vyth. Kaos and Spark flank Kall. Fionnlagh trails back a little from the group. 

We follow the trail for a few hours and it starts to get dusky. Jar pulls out the lantern of revealing.
We end up at a clearing in the middle of the clearing are overgrown ruins.

Spark hopes that this is a holy place and wants to have a closer look. He throws out a rat from his bag of tricks. "Gond has provided us the perfect companion". He sends out the rat to find enemies and traps. There is one thing a little higher, a statue. The rat skitters around the ruins but avoids a certain area.

Spark notices that Kall even though she wasn´t injured in the fight she has been avoiding her right side and using her walking stick a little more. Spark asks her about this and she takes him for a walk. Fionnlagh unsuccesfully tries to follow them with stealth. Kall shows Spark a little purple scratch on her sight. Spark casts remove curse on the wound. The purple glow goes away, the skin gets it's colour back, but it shows the glitch again. It however looks/feels a little different than a normal curse removal. Kall tells him she wasn't entirely honest. "I did find the high priestess, a sort of dead. She scratched me and I stabbed her with my staff. But I am still hoping we can find her and bring her back. I would give my life for that. I have a fuzzy little ball filled with hope, I keep near my heart as one does."

Kaos tries to get an echo in the clearing, it doesn´t work. 

Kaos and Jar talk about a crazy plan to heat up Sparks metal and yeet Spark towards enemies. Spark asks politely not to do this to him.

The turned over earth the rat avoided is a patch with a hole in it, where it looks like someone crawled out. It kinda looks like there is a room down the hole with straight edges, maybe a lower floor of the building.

Spark lights a prayer candle and throws it down the hole. Kaos comes closer and tries to investigate the hole more. She sees that the area is a place where a regular animal would make a den. On the lower floor Spark sees some collapsed down earth, some crates and a big and small door.

Kaos drops Vyth down the hole.
