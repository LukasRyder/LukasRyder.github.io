# Session 020

what happened:
-Chaos defeated the Kobold champion. The tribe was forced to reluctantly admit the existence of their dragon ruler.
-Finn went off to explore and shortly after the Kobold champion was defeated, the group reunited in the hoard of the white dragon.
-Finn finds a poor blind kobold in the food storage deep in the ice layers. He was the guardian of the treasure along with some ice trolls. The rest of the group also meet him trying to find Finn. 
-Thanks to some advanced diplomacy by Morn and Jar, the incident of Finn sneaking off to the dragon hoard was overlooked and as tradition requires, a feast was held.
-Jar is a picky eater so refuses most of what the Kobolts call ‚Äúfood‚Äù but attempts to pretend he's eating.
-Morn is cornered by the Kobold Shaman and she confesses the feast is actually poisoned and he gives Morn an antidote. It works for 3 people. The group is 5.
-Morn drinks a bit and gives the rest to Koda and Finn. Jar having not eaten any is fine. Chaos being a half orc‚Ä¶ well she has had worse for breakfast. 
-The next day, the group went down the ice tunnels below the kobold village.
On the way down we found an old Dwarf that was held hostage as guarantee for a far off dwarven kingdom. Eager to escape, the old dwarf wizard armed the group with spell scrolls and arrows to exact his revenge on the dragon. 
-Found the tunnel leading to the dragon‚Äôs den.
-The group arm the reality bomb and give it to Chaos. They all formulate a plan and go.
-Finn stayed up on high ground, while the rest made its way down to the floor level of this ice dome
-A dragon starts to emerge from the ice water, shit what did we do
-An Ice troll approaches from the opposite side of the room, and Jar and Koda fight the creature (charmed or so to be focussing only on that one, not the dragon).
-Morn and Chaos slowly approach the dragon from either side of the ice structure in the middle of the ice dome, barely missing the traps that were set there. Finn uses his bow to deal some damage.
-Then (almost) everyone gets some damage, ouch
-Inspired and Blessed, Chaos launches the bomb at the dragon! The bomb works üôÇ
-Jar is badly hit by the dragon‚Äôs breath and drops to 0 hit points and loses 3 death saves. Vyth turns off. üò¶ 
-Dragon is hurt badly, cannot walk anymore and uses only claws and breath attacks
-Jar is out cold and dying
-Chaos and Morn deal some blows, whereas Finn beats the dragon with 2 outstanding shots and Koda deals with what remains of the Ice troll!
-Morn revives Jar after the dragon is slayed
-The monsters have been dealt with, we do some looting
-The iceberg of the dragon starts to collapse and everyone must escape
-And make our way back to the kobold village and take them with us to Emberhold
Everyone needs some therapy, probably
