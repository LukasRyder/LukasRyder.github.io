# Session 027

On the way back to Emberholt Morn asks Chaos and Spark for information about their adventures.
Jar says Vyth is getting Chonky, Morn and Chaos are exicited about the posibility of little Vyth puppies. Jar corrects them, he is growing not pregnant.

It is heading into summer. The sea is becoming a little more unfrozen. Jar en Chaos see pinguins out in the see, but as Morn and Fionnlagh miss them. Chaos tries to run after them into the sea as Morn tries to hold her back. They are both waist deep. And Jar casts a vortex and brings them back to shore. 

Morn greets Big Tom and he says the wizards wanted to speak to them. Everyone goes with to the tower. Algernon says Duerth remembered some things. His place was called Castle Sunblight. He and the other Sunblight childeren were send out to find stuff, maybe if we find one of the brothers they can help us find the castle.

Arcturus asks Jar to help build a compass to find the brothers. He also mentions that the Prodegy asked to check in to Algernon. He isn´t replying to the sending messages the prodigy sends them. Jar and Morn decide to go in and bring him food. Chaos decides to make Algernon firewood. 

Morn asks Arcturus why the Prodegy is coming back. Arcturus is a little hesistant to tell why, but says it could change things. Something has been found up here or at least a rumour of something. Keep your eye out for stuff like the upside down tower. Morn sees a compass it has a Chardalyn crystal with purple blood on it. It is Duerths blood.

Duerth and Fionnlagh are still downstairs. Fionn is looking to drawers, but they are all empty and Duerth calls him out on it.

Jar and Chaos come back. Morn knocks on the door of Algernon. Chaos goes in first. She suddenly lets go of the wood and then walks back down the stairs.  Jar offers him the six months ago promised breakfast. Algernon mumbles about the rhym of the frostmaiden that the prodedy is looking for. Arcturus says this isn´t something you guys should be bothered with. It is just for wizards.

Jar remembers one of the most practised of the tinkering people should have been living in a city of hidden knowledge. Morn and Fionnlagh know the frostmaiden is a primordial diety that isn´t in any active pantheon anymore. There isn´t a connection to any of the current gods.

Arcturus says non of this is important and ... then Jar tries to cast sleep on him. Arcturus calls him out on it and Jar apologises. Arcturus keeps saying he isn´t really allowed to talk about it. Arcturus does want to go with the adventurers to find the sons of Sunblight, when they go out to look for them. 

Building the compass takes five days. Fionnlagh helps out with his slight of hand

Morn is helping with the healers and gets admiration and has a good conversation with Klothak. Chaos tries to give a good performance in the Elemental Fundamentals. Jar tries to offer his Kobolt ale to the people. Everyone passes out from drinking it. Chaos uses a spell to make Harper clap for her performance. She takes a bow and exits the stage.

Fionnlagh prepares a Potion of Fire Breath.

Fionnlagh stops his meditation at like 3 AM doesn´t notice anything. Morn wakes up thinks it is still early as it is dark and goes back to sleep. Chaos wakes up gets a drink and goes back to sleep. Jar wakes up in a closet of pillows, calls for Vyth and takes a walk with Vyth it is extremly cold outside. Jar notices an extreme cold. A warning bell goes off. Chaos and Morn wake up again, as does the rest of the town. Harper asks do you know anything about this, the sun hasn´t risen.

Everybody assembles at the Elemental Fundamentals. Jar examines the stone in the middle of the town it seems normal.

Fionnlagh goes out to an altar to pray to his god. There is nothing specific. He hears something but nothing he can make out, unclear of it is a god or his own thoughts. Maybe the gods are as confused as he is.

Arcturus brings the compass and says it is nearly done, maybe we should finish it.

Jar tries to talk to Algernon to ask if he knows about it. Algernon comes down angryly and asks what people have done. He talks about a bird that brought slightly more darkness. The bird flew back at 3 AM, and it still looks as dark as 3 AM even though the stars still move.

Spark tries to ask his god questions and the more questions the higher the chance of wrong answers, so keeps being more and more confused. Jar goes up to tower and uses his magic rope to make a magic ladder. He goes up and he shot a magic stone out. It makes a hole to the clouds, but not the darkness. Jar steps of the top and featherfalls down.

Arcturus says it is probably regular nighttime. Fionnlagh finishes the compass. There is an icy blue light and the crystal rotates a little but points about East. It is following someone South, either the person is going really fast or close.

Harper sends a sending message to the prodegy asking how it is right now. An assistant has the ring and says it is okay. Harper says she will get everyone under control.

Fionnlagh proposes to go an "Heroes Mission" so the townsfolk will be reassured (and so he doesn´t have to be around all the people.) Harper does an announcement to the town about that it is just a little dark right now. Morn goes through the crowd and reassures people. Jar and Chaos try to do an announcement and Fionnlagh is also on stage. They realise that the compass points right at Duerth, People think Duerth is the cause of the Darkness. Chaos carefully persuades the crowd, they are confused but calm a little.

Arcturus says sorry didn´t think about that. He plans to make a shield around Duerth so it doesn´t point at him. Chaos realises that Sunblight means a blight on the sun and that it is connected. Either the compass is the cause or the Sunblight people are the cause. Fionnlagh is very shaken up, and a voice cuts through saying Soon you will have to make a choice.

Arcturus brings back a ring for Duerth and the compass focusses on another point. Jar and Chaos work on improving the automatised [Steamship](./Steamship.md). Spark helps by cleaning it up and make it look pretty

It is still freezing and before we go Chaos chops wood for the people. Arcturus comes in full wizards gear with cloacks adorned with stars etc. Morn compliments him and therefore he gets a nice spell back making him scent like cedarwood etc.
Arcturus makes a floating disk for Spark to sit on in his big overcoat.

It is around 2PM and Jar navigates with Chaos' help as he can´t really see in the darkness. He is quite relaxed about it and talking to Vyth.

Fionn sits on the boat holding his little stone that always feels warm. As he does he hears the same voice break through again. "Do enjoy that little gift I gave you".

It is clear that the point on the compass doesn´t move, the person is stationary. We are traveling for eight hours. Fionnlagh is feeling because his internal clock is off. He goes to sleep in the boat. The others discuss about how to push on. Spark asks to recast the disk. Spark says he will be century, Arcturus will be stearing the boat. They notice that the ice is getting thicker. Vyth is being put in front of the ship to function as flamethrower whenever the ice gets to much. Morn at some point changes places with Arcturus. 

Halfway through the long rest we wake up to vyth trying to melt a block of ice. Morn banks the boat and Chaos tries to push off from the iceberg. After a long rest. 

The next "morning". Jar takes a half day to repair the damage to the boat. Fionnlagh hears the mating calls of penguins who are awaiting spring. 

We see a sort of beach, and there is an portruding thing off the glacier/icewall. We dock at the beach. Vyth burns a curving slope and Spark and Chaos pull it on top of the ice. Chaos nails two tentpegs in the sand/clay beach and ties the rope with a beach.

There is something flapping from the shape. Everybody ties themselves together, except Fionn.


There is a big segmanted tail, 20ft above us. It doesn´t have legs. It is clearly metal.

There are big splits in the ice, tunnels going through the ice.

Fionnlagh teleports on top of the tail. There is a 15 ft spike on the front of it. The icewall is still 30ft. up. Fionn is able to look into the ice wall. It is clearly metal. There is an insulated material made from sealskin

The others walk into the crack trying to see what is there. Morn notices a small passage. He sees something jump over the that crack on top. 

Fionn takes a potion of firebreath and takes two deep breaths. Opens a manhole and very silently goes down a ladder. Everything is made from solid metal and it is very dark. He uses his sending ring to send "So I am inside now. There is an opening on top of this. Come join me."

The others discuss and decide to go into the passage. They all make it through. There is a large dome above them, It is partly into the ice. There is a 4m long "narwal horn" made from Chardalyn just like the crystal. Jar sees that there is a window, but it is in the ice. some type of windshield above the horn.

Fionnlagh tries to pick a lock but fails and triggers a trap which causes the lock to be frozen.

At the place the others are, there are bright blinking lights. Jar uses his firebreath to melt ice and there is suddenly a lot of heat and steam that can´t escape. Jar sees someone in a control chair. Very stock, braided beard, blue skin, frozen to his chair. A Duregart, in full armor made from the same material as the horn. There is also a door with is 

Fionnlagh uses two flairs to melt the lock. He sees chests in  Black orb from quartz. It wants to be put back in the chest. I tell it I will if it gives me information. It doesn´t so I put it in my satchel. I also
Arcana scroll not legible to be and three short swords.

There is a lot of mist and there seems to be someone walking around him

Jar breaks through the window and then they all step in.
Jar recognises the runes, they are similar to the 
Morn recognises that the man is still looking around. Morn melts the ice around his shoulder and he cures wounds. His jaw reattaches. Chaos also cures some of his wounds.

There is a lot of mist and there seems to be someone walking around him. Fionnlagh hears "Why have you disturbed me? My work is not yet finished"

Morn, Jar and Chaos find a way to communicate, They unthaw his face and cure some of his wounds. 
He says my name is "Nildar Sunblight"

Fionnlagh feels hands on his neck and a ghost takes possesion of him.

The others hear a loud large creature on top of the thing.
