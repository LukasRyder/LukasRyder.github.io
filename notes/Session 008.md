# Session 008

The group arrives in Emberhold and has a much-needed rest. In the morning, Jar brings breakfast to Arcturis and Algernon in Witreach Tower. He helps Arcturis with some of his equipment, and tells him of the artefacts they found on their last journey. Arcturis warns him that the company they work for may be interested in such items, if they are deemed 'technology' (as per the contract they signed). The two of them discuss ideas about travelling by boat to revisit the colossus and Arcturis offers to accompany them. Jar does not hide his anger about his companions leaving him to die in the crypt.

Harper runs into Morn while making the rounds outside in the growing blizzard, and asks after Smushey's fate. She asks Morn to gather his companions in the Elemental Fundamentals. There is obvious tension in the group after their last adventures. Morn retrieves Algernon, who tells Morn of his suspicions that Finn may be a spy. They all sit down together in the tavern and Jar drinks copious amounts of ale. Harper insists the group make haste and solve the issue of the insect attacks. The group estimates travel time by boat, and think that if they acquire some climbing equipment, they will be able to scale the ice wall around the colossus and shave off some travel time.

Finn wants to restore the colossus. Jar is still nervous about the white dragon. More debates and votes ensue. Finally, Algernon asks to speak with Harper, Arcturis and Morn privately. They all convene in Harper's office/chambers and Algernon expresses his concerns. He accuses Finn of being a spy, and offers up evidence: Finn does not share his history with anyone, the sea creature that attacked the fisher's spoke only to Finn and made a deal that would put a strain on Emberhold's food supply, he fled from the tree before the attacks began, he was the first to find the hole beneath the tree, and other suspicious actions. Algernon suspects Finn has hidden powers. Harper and Arcturis are troubled by this, and Harper promises to send a message to a contact back at the company headquarters to look into Finn's history. Morn tells Arcturis of the stone slab in the crypt. Arcturis requests guards to accompany him on their trip back to the colossus, which Harper grants.

Back at the tavern, a fisherman named Peyton asks Finn to help keep away bad omens. The people of Emberhold have noticed the recent string of bad luck. Some are extremely superstitious and some blame these new adventurer's for bringing ill luck. Finn suggests he try lighting a candle to his goddess, but is hesitant to share the name of his goddess. Finally, he calls her the “moon maiden” and “our lady of silver”. 

The private meeting is ended, and they all gather together again. They straighten out the details of their plans for the following day. They will use boats, somehow strung together, to hopefully drag the colossus heart back to Emberhold. Arcturis tells them that repairing it and leaving the crystal behind is too temporary of a solution, and the dragon would likely return and destroy it again. Jar worries that bringing it back to Emberhold will put a target on the outpost. Arcturis wants to send it through the teleportation circle, back to the mainland. Arturis suggests a whaling expedition on the way. His theory is that the whale blubber that keeps the beasts warm in the arctic, may also help in insulating the crystal's power.

They meet Urin Barrelchin, the dwarven blacksmith of Emberhold. Jar manages to convince her to assist him with a contraption requiring metal.

After a hearty evening meal, Finn goes to sleep. Morn and Jar stay up with a group of workers in the tavern and drink ale, tell tales, and have a social evening. Morn tries to sneak water into Jar's drinks to stave off the dragonborn's expected hangover. The worker's take a liking to Morn especially, and some seem less concerned about the adventurer's as a whole after this interaction.

Jar stays awake all night, drunk and tinkering. In the late morning when Morn goes to check on him, the cleric is greeted by a mechanical dog-like creature that Jar has created. Algernon informs the group that he will be staying in Emberhold to continue his studies of the sky, and says farewell to the group.
