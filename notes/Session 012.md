# Session 012

As the party sails back toward Emberhold, they contemplate the crystal's purpose. The party is still divided on how they should proceed with such a powerful item. Day breaks, and a swarm of canoes appear on the horizon, filled to the brim with angry kobolds. They attack, vying for the crystal, and one of the fishers dies during the struggle. Eventually, the party overtakes them and the leader, Flank, surrenders and tells the others to "get the heart back". 

They question Flank about the crystal. He tells them it's for the "Lord of Ice", the "Eternal Frost", and the "White Death", among other names. Morn heals the wounded while Flank explains to Jar that this white dragon is half dragon, half mechanical, which explains the strange claw marks they saw in the glacier near the colossus. Morn tries to earn Flank's trust, but the kobold is suspicious. Morn promises they will not harm him, though some of the others may disagree.
