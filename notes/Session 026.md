# Session 026

Vyth is in the hole and has the assignement to see if the coast is clear and then come back. He is in a small room with reminants of wooden crates. There is decorative engravings on the walls. On the left is a big double doorframe, with the doors missing. It is dark in the room beyond. Vyth doesn´t see any dead bodies and he reports back to Jar.

Jar walks down whilst holding eye contact with Spark. Spark and Kall also walk down. With the lantern of revealing Jar sees thee empty room beyond the doorway, it has a band of decoration with circles, squiggles and handprints. Kaos convices Fionnlagh to come down with her. 

Spark sends the rat with a candle into the hallway trying to detect traps. No traps seem to be detected. Fionn gets impatient and walks in balancing on the edge of the lowered pit inside the room. Spark opens the doors to the cell like rooms on the left. He sees two piles of bones in the first room. In the second room he sees what resembles the remains of one person. Spark examines the rooms to see if someone broke the celldoors open from the inside or outside. Kaos does the same, her being locked up before notices that the doors have been unlocked and not broken and that the only can be unlocked from the outside. Jar invesitgates the markings on the wall, but doesn´t recognise them. Kaos investigates the remains in the right cell. The bones are of indeterminate race, they look small. She does however notice that the first has blunt teethmarks on the bones and that some of the bones have cracks with some putplish residu. 

Spark tries the floor of the lowered pit with his hammer and noting happens. He theorises that it might be an arcane research facility where something went "wrong". He inspect one of the rooms, which looks like a bedroom also with some remains half on the bed. The next room looks similar which has trashed furniture in a corner. There are two skeletons, one holding an object. The trashed furniture seems to move, Jar joins him in the doorway. They see mice the size of rats. Kaos walks up to join them.

Spark uses Word of Radiance to scare of the swarm of mice. Then Kall attacks them, double attack, the second one a crit with her staff. Fionn is still hanging back and doesn´t join in on the fight yet. The swarm circles Spark and tries to attack and misses. Kaos tries to attack with her blessed war axe. Just before she hits them she sees the same glitch, some seem to dissapear and she misses. Jar says "eeuwh" and sends a firebolt towards the rats. He smashes a lot of the mice whilst doing so. Spark casts toll the death which does necrotic damage and even though they are resistant, the remaining mice still die.

Spark takes a look at the object the skeleton holds. The skeletons are quite thight together. The object is a potion. It has a label in Dwarvish script. Noone can read it, but Fionnlagh uses his alchemist abilities to guess it is something like potion of hero or warrior. Fionnlagh thinks he is the obvious choice for the potion. It tastes a little off but 10 temp hitpoints and blessed for 1 hour. The last room is similar.

There is a room on the other side of the hall way. It has empty basins carved out of stone, there also seems to be a stone altar and a stairway up (probably leading back up to the surface) Kaos goes into the room first and scatters sand in the hope that it detects traps. The staircase doesnt seem to lead anywhere just goes into the ceiling. The altar has a humanoid siluette on it with a halo of light beams. Fionnlagh recognises the inscription.

Jar uses some diluted dragon blood and spills it into one of the basins and nothing happens.

Spark goes up the stairs and a mechanism triggers which opens a hatch coming out behind the statue.

There are inscriptions on the wall. A woman with her hands up together and clouds being there around it. Fionnlagh recognises it. Kaos notices that the swirls look similar to something she has seen in her vision.

Spark mimics the pose and Fionnlagh hits his head because he is disrespectful. Kaos does the same and also gets hit. Fionnlaghs tells them to wash up. He poors water in the basin and washes his hands there. Nothing is happens but he sees a little button and pushes it. He makes everyone wash their hands and push the button. 

When that happens, the ladies arms open as the wall opens up. In the room behind it there is a large purple orb and "the shredder" ready to charge. The shredder has white fur and look vaguely like a wolf, but it definitely isn´t he has extra limbs with weird bending points. he has a third eye and his mouth opens up way back onto his body, all the way back to his shoulders. He has extra bumps and has a purple glow where the extra limbs attach and bend.

Jar casts Scortching Rain and sets Vyth to do a force balisata attack. Kaos casts earth tremmor. Fionnlagh sends two arrows. The creature hids behind the door trim. Spark casts heat metal on the chains around the orb, they glow red hot and the damage the orb. Spark commands the rat to run into the room with the shredder.

Jar asks Spark and decides to shoots a firebolt at the creature again and Vyth attacks the orb. The creature at that point tries to attack Chaos, but Spark intervenes with silver barbs coming from him, causing The Shredder to miss.

Chaos attacks the creature with her war axe and crits. Fionnlagh hides behind others and sends two more arrows into the creature. The Shredder seems to be knitting together again, but not really in the way it was before. It skin is bulging and bubbling, appandices flair out Kall, Chaos and Spark take the full hit. 

Spark tries to hit it and misses and gives the creature to attack once he tries to move away. The creature then moves to attack Chaos. Kall then attacks the creature. 

Jar shift focus and he and Vyth both attack the sphere. The orb become smaller and gotten harder to hit. Chaos ends it and Fionn does some more arrows on the creature. The creature than attacks Spark and Kall. Spark then also attacks and then the rat also tries an attack, which fails.

Kall then goes into attack and punches some of its teeth out. The creature decides to move out of range. 

Jar and Vyth both attack and both crit on the creature. The shredder is looking really bad it does no longer have the strength to pick up its lower jaw. Chaos tries to put it to sleep it yawns, but doesn´t fall asleep. After she vicious mocks him, but the creatures feelings weren´t hurt.

Fionnlagh hits it with two arrows. The creature attacks Fionnlagh and then Kall sees the creature almost dead and punches outs its eyes. A purple mist leave the body. It leaves an empty wolf pelt. 

Spark kneels next to Kall and tries to calm her. Jar stabs Spark with a needle and heals him. 

Spark uses his spirit guardians to flush the last two rooms. The first is kind of a tool shed with a workbench and a lot of cabinets and tools. The second room has more stone work benches, also some weapons and more bones. Then he goes to the backwall he sees some stone plates with engravings. Spark looks at the crack which is behind the pile of leftovers. The crack has a small dug out space and there is a kobolt in torn clothes. She looks injured, but hasn´t any purple glow. Spark shouts for glow. The kobolt perks up but is quite weak. Spark heals the kobolt and Kall and the kobolt run into eachothers arms like there is nobody else in the world. It turns out to be her lover.

Spark notices that Fionnlagh takes the pelt.

In the "Crystal Room" there is a lever that opens the room from the inside. There is also some decorative patterns on the wall. The stone engravings there are two on the left and one on the right, which also has a space for a possible fourth one.

Spark finds some glass shards he picks up into the sack of the flaming warhammer without touching them.

Jar in toolshed and investigates the items. The stone plate looks like someone was carving an image of the sphere on it. It has the same squibles that where emerging from the sphere into a something that wasn´t finished yet. 

The plates:
1. a ritual of some sort. people stand around a circle of some sort 
2. Something comes down from the sky into the circle.
3. Some squiggles going into the sphere.
4. (unfinished) something coming out of the sphere.

Flashes of lighting and a hovering island in a valley with lighting coming and going. The squiggles look like the lightning.

Jar takes the stonetools and Spark helps investigate the workplace for interesting tools, which Sparks can (and does) repair. There is two really old bodiess, with no longer having any purple marks. They find a morning start, it has a metal wire with a colourless dull crystal in the handle of the weapon. It is not a material which Jar is familiar with. it seems like a catalyst or holder for magical energy.

Spark tries to figure out if the bones should be burried with respect or can they be used to make stuff. Spark realises they were creatures of his God but they strayed far from his path. Spark takes as much bones as possible. Jar realises he misses Morn as he overhears Spark saying "Don´t worry I will make you into something".

The shards and the crystals in the morning star are from the same origin. Jar takes one of the shards Spark collected. 

Fionnlagh prays at the altar. Spark asks why he took the skin and why he prayed. Fionn answers because "People died in here" they have a fundamental misunderstanding about whether people are/the world is good.

Chaos carries the bones of the kobolts back to the village.

Jar collects some the shredders wolfs teeth from the ground.

Spark decides this isn´t the space to lays his makers bones to rest and everyone walks back to the kobolts village.

The kobolts pray over the funeral pyre and thank the adventurers. Jar gives Morn the Morningstar. Morn doesn´t want it and Fionnlagh says he wants it. Morn is praying with the kobolts. 

Spark talks to Jar, Morn and Chaos about Fionnlagh being weird and having the magical weapon now. It doesn´t Morn. Jar says "you are new. It is something that happens with teenagers. He is like 16." Morn isn´t suspicious. Jar "isn´t suspicious either. He will just kill us at some point". 
Morn: "I tried to get to know him, but I have given up."
Jar: "Alcohol is the key" 
Morn: "he does´t drink" 
Jar: "but WE do"

The funeral pyre dies out slowly, Jar gets drunk and we have a full nights rest. We ride back to Emberhold.
