# Session 014

The adventurers wake to find Fionnlagh and the Prodigy are missing, and the dome around them has dropped, leaving them in an icy wind. The sorcerers continue their work on the teleportation circle, and they suddenly see a bright blue light emerging from the ocean. Skeletons draped in dripping and decaying clothing, led by a coldlight walker, attack from the ocean. 

Meanwhile, the Prodigy has brought Fionnlagh to his old monastery. He asks his intentions, and Finn assures him he simply seeks adventure, and has no ill will toward the Grand Venture Co. Seemingly satisfied with his response, the Prodigy sends him back. Finn is returned in the midst of a battle against the undead, and deals the finishing blow to the lead coldlight walker. They dispatch the skeletons before they can destroy the crystal, and the sorcerer’s transport the crystal away. 

They allow the kobolds to return to their village and make plans to meet with them in one week’s time. The party then returns to Emberhold. Morn speaks with Daero and suggests they celebrate the upcoming celebration of Snow’s End with a festival, to lift everyone's spirits. Daero gladly agrees, and they begin preparations. In the meantime, Finn helps with repairs on the sinkhole in Emberhold, and notices tunnels beneath the outpost.
