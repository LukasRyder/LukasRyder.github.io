# Session 015

The party enjoyed a week’s rest in Emberhold, wherein they celebrated Snow’s End Festival with a day full of games and competitions. Fionnlagh and Jar compete in an archery contest to show off their skills. Morn and Chaos bravely compete in the drinking contest (including the beer brewed by Jar and Koda), and with the aid of his cleric abilities, Morn is able to stay upright after the contest is complete. Morn visits the fortune teller and notices a strange glow on his mace after receiving his secret mission from Helm. Koda makes a brave attempt at pig racing, and manages to complete the race with minimal scarring and a lot of mud on her. Jar then visits the fortune teller, but his experience is quite different, and he finds himself face-to-face with a strange elf-like figure. The figure bestows abilities on Jar. 

Finally, the evening wraps up with a talent show. Jar shows off his usual explosive abilities. Fionnlagh turns pyrotechnics into an impressive show of acrobatics. Chaos rocks out on her rad new instrument. And Morn recites an inspiring poem to the people of Emberhold. 

With that, the evening commences in a display of fireworks and a continuous evening of revelry for all.
