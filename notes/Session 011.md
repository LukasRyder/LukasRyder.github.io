# Session 011

Jar discovers a clockwork cube underneath the colossus control panel. He attempts to pry a diamond from the dome and Arcturis warns against it. Jar, however, convinces him that it is necessary. Fionnlagh takes the snowy owlbear claws and skins one for the hide, whilst Koda takes the other hide and drapes it over the two remaining eggs in the nest. Koda notices the skeleton in the nest and finds a decomposing pouch containing coins and some vials.

The party takes a short rest and discuss how they will remove the crystal safely from the colossus. After much discussion, they return to the ship and construct a pulley system. After some minor electrocution, a thin crack appears on the crystal and it splits. A bolt of lightning is released from within and whirls around frantically before attacking Chaos. Chaos receives a vision when she is hit. The party fights the lightning bolt and Fionnlagh sings to it. The bolt seems to respond to the song and Chaos joins in. The bolt flees.

The fishers return with a whale and the group manages to lower the crystal to the boats (somewhat) safely. The sun sets and they notice in the southwest that a storm still swirls, seemingly unmoving. The group takes another rest and a snowball fight occurs. Finally, they sail away as evening hits. Morn finds Arcturis and thanks the wizard for his spell assist during the fight against the snowy owlbears. The group sails into the night.
