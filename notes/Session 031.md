# Session 031

We are traveling west to Solstice

The knots Fionnleigh is tied up with unravel and there stands an icey blue polar bear.

Jar tells Chaos Morn is possesed. A fight follows between Fionn and the rest of the group, during which Morn gets bit by Fionn, but doesn't get infected. Nass leaves Morn's body. After which Morn has a panic attack. Acturus helpfully suggests "have you tried not being afraid¨. Morn heals himself and Acturus casts a magic circle to protect from the undeath, specifically Nass. Jar sends a flaming sphere at Fionn's feet, who then changes to a hybrid-bear form asking ¨Dude, what the fuck?!" 

Morn and Fionn end up having a conversation about friends. Fionn admitting he has non. Morn telling Fionn he considers him family. Fionn reacts ¨I don't know about family, you should teach me about that".

Jar tries to find a way to make Nass a body, but it doesn't work. Chaos lets Nass posses her for a bit, but then asks her to leave.

Morn performs an adulthood ceremony for Fionn. Fionn hears a voice saying ¨this is good choose freedom". Chaos gives Fionn a carved eagle, which Fionn adds to his necklace. Acturus promises mocktails and suggest to make this day Fionn birthday as nobody knows the actual day. Acturus also gives him a frozen man figure. Jar gives him a folded piece of paper with a formal invitation to join his guild (but there would be some tests to succeed first). 

We see a long row of ice sculptures, of all kinds of creatures, streching both ways, forming a lit up line in the darkness. There is four arches in the row, they are named: cruelty, preservation, isolation and endurance. Morn sees a statue of a human woman blink. Nass breaks an eyelash of her statue, but nothing happens. Fionn shadowsteps behind the statue and screams in her ear. A thic fog rolls in on the other side of the line and a tower rises from it. All the statues start talking at the same time "The Frost maiden, choose one¨.

The group needs to make a decision together, and even though Jar wants preservation, Arcturus wants isolation, Chaos wants endurance and Fionn and Nass vote cruelty, the consensus ends up being isolation.

When we step to the portal we see a bright light and snow everywhere. There is a camp of four iglo's. We see a woman with thick dreadlocks wearing loose furs sitting against a sabertooth tiger. The woman says "get in the Frostmaiden send you". She introduces herself as Bjornhilled Solvigdötter. She sais the tribe is going on an elk hunt and they need someone to look after the buildings. Everyone in the Regged tribe is armed, even the kids.

There is a slight blue light and a snowflake above everyones head and Nass is no longer with us. Bjornhilled explains that this is the mark of the Frost maiden.

After the tribe leaves we explorer. Square iglo's, with bones lying around everywhere. Each iglo has a front door and a hole in the ceiling. There are no supplies. Fionn lights a fire. Morn feels that time seems to be weird, but Arcturus says it is normal to him.
