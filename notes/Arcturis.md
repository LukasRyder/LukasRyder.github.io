# Arcturis

A young man, researcher.

As a student at the academy, Arcturis wanted to do transmutation magic to turn organic matter into magical energy (turning hitpoints into spell slots). This was forbidden in the academy because the magic was new and too dangerous for students. Arcturis and a classmate wanted to try it anyway, and broke into the library at night and experimented with this technique on some chickens. The chickens died but the magic was out of control and killed his classmate too. Because of this, Arcturis gained more magical power. The prodigy saw it happen and expelled him, expecting Arcturis would come to him to beg to return to the academy. This indeed happened, and he made Arcturis steal tundra maps from a rivalling company. Arcturis succeeded, the prodigy launched the expedition and hired Arcturis as soon as he finished his studies. 

What Arcturis doesnâ€™t know is that the prodigy staged the accident, because he saw he was exceptionally skilled and he wanted to bind him to him. He made Arcturis find books about biomatter magic transmutation and left the keys to the library in a place where he knew he would find them.
