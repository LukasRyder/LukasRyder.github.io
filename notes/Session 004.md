# Session 004

The adventurers are back in [Emberhold](./Emberhold.md), where they see the outpost has once again been attacked by the [insect creatures](./Rhemorhaz.md) in their absence. [Harper](./Harper.md) expresses her disappointment that they have not yet solved the issue of the attacks. They discuss what to do next, and if there truly is a [white dragon](./White Dragon.md) living in the glacier. No one in Emberhold has seen signs of a white dragon’s presence in the years of the outpost’s existence. 

[Smushey](./Smushey.md) decides to leave for a few days with a group of lumberjacks to help rebuild after the attack, and they travel into the forest north of Emberhold.

A new group of carpenters, labourers and a lost adventurer arrive in the meantime. The carpenters set to work on repairing the charred and torn down defenses. The lost adventurer is a Dwarf woman named [Koda](./Koda.md).

The adventurers continue to discuss their next moves, [Jar](./Jar.md) going so far as to suggest the creation of a black hole between two bags of holding. As they converse, a man bursts into the [Elemental Fundamentals](./Elemental Fundementals.md). He exclaims that there is trouble on the waters. They all go out to see a group of fishermen in [Broken Ice Bay](Broken Ice Bay.md) being attacked by something. 

The group jumps onto boats and battle an [underwater beast](./Plesiosaurus.md). When the beast is hit with an attack, [Fionnlagh](./Fionnlagh.md) being the only member of the party who speaks Elvish, hears it shout in a very rough and uncultured accent: “Oi mate, that bloody hurt you bastard!”
