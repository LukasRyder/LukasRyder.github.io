# Session 013

The party debates what to do with the crystal. Arcturis informs them about their mysterious boss, known only as the Prodigy. Their kobold prisoners ask to be released and mention tunnels beneath their village. The party takes their hostages and travel overnight. Arcturis reveals some of his history, vaguely mentioning mistakes he made in his university days, and the Prodigy finding and hiring him after he was expelled.

They leave the crystal on the shore with half the party while the rest return to Emberhold and tell Harper what they’ve accomplished. Harper informs them of another Rhemorhaz attack on the outpost two days ago, where a sinkhole killed one citizen. They find a witness to the event, Old Hal, who seems shaken. He claims a spectre flew out of the woman who died and fled into the centre of Emberhold, and vanished into the orb. Old Hal looks for comfort in Finnolagh’s goddess. Morn and Finn pray over the sinkhole to their respective deities. 
Back at the crystal, Koda notices more animals flocking the area.

Everyone in Emberhold is nervous and excited to meet the Prodigy. He arrives with several powerful-looking guards. They immediately return to the crystal, where Koda tries to pat the Prodigy’s head and is nearly disintegrated by the guards before the Prodigy laughs it off. He congratulates the adventurers and offers them a raise, and some rings to allow them to communicate with one another. 

Jar shows the Prodigy the white dragon scale, and he insists the adventurers find the dragon and dispose of it. Jar asks if they would take the kobold refugees and the Prodigy considers it so long as they can provide information.
The Prodigy puts up a dome for the night and they all sleep while the guards work on an all-night teleportation circle around the crystal.
