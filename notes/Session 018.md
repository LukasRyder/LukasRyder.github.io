# Session 018

The party continues to explore the structure buried in the ice, upside-down, beneath Emberhold. They open the chest bolted to the ceiling and potions fall out. They manage to catch a few, and the others smash and break. They fight a few remorhaz as they emerge from below, then move on through the levels. In the rooms they discover decomposed bodies, scattered books, and Chaos finds a magic ring on the finger of a skeleton. Morn finds a key that unlocks a small meeting room with a silence spell inside the entire chamber. 

The group encounters an invisible man, and using the lantern of revealing they find out he is a wizard named Dzaan. He tells them of his tower and shows an illusion of a floating city. Jar tells him everything about their quest, and Dzaan realizes his people must have lost the war. He tells them of two sisters and their factions: The Mind and The Balance. Morn asks why he cannot leave the room, and the wizard explains that he is simply an echo of his master.

Fionnlagh is especially interested in Dzaan’s tales, and asks more about the sisters, whose names were Selune and Shar. The sisters were fused together as punishment by the gods. Dzaan agrees to help them with the dragon if they use his amulet to bring him to the top of the tower, where he can make his illusions into reality. The ritual requires a life sacrifice. Fionnlagh is keen to help but the rest are hesitant.

Chaos slips on the ring she found and speaks with the captured soul of Imdra, an apprentice of Dzaan’s. She tells Chaos about her boss, claiming he did great things. As Chaos and Jar move to the next level of the tower, they see the slithering body of a gigantic remorhaz.
