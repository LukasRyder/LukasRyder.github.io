# Session 023

[Arcturus](./Arcturus.md) sends everyone away from his [tower](./Arcturuses Tower.md), so he can research in peace

[Fionnlagh](./Fionnlagh.md) is gone... there is a note on his door "I need to do a thing, sacrifices and such. Back soon!" [Morn](./Morn.md) sees this when he goes to his room.

Jar and Kaos are drinking. One of the carpenters [Big Tom](./Big Tom.md) living in the village storms in > His kid Little Tom is missing. 

No one knows exact where he is, but someone has seen the kid following Fionnlagh around before.

Jar, Kaos and Morn go with Big Tom to find something of Little Tom to smell. Jar wants and explanation about human reproduction.

Kaos investigates the town, Jar investigates the house. Morn finds a journal. Drawings and stuff of Fionnlagh. One is of the north gate with Fionn walking into the forest.

Guard tells them Fionnlagh went out and he left his post after. Two pairs of footprints. 

Jar bets 3 coppers Little Tom killed Fionnlagh
Kaos bets 1 silver Little Tom accidentally joined the cult

After fourty minutes a building is a little bit of the path. Jar gives everyone temporary hit points.

They see a campfire with Spark sitting there, looking like a statue. Morn comes up closer and says "Hello?" Jar is a little scared and baffled. Morn starts a conversation and asks if he seen a elf and or a human kid.

Jar introduces Vyth to Spark. Spark ask if he is also a creation of Gond. Morn and Spark bond over being Clerics. Spark is impressed with Vyth, Jar offers to make Spark some things. They offer to invite him over to Emberhold, after they find the kid.

Spark tells them about the mountains region he is from. He is looking for a holy place. Morn tells him about his temple of Helm. He is looking for a holier place to rest the soul of his creator, the "Saint" Costaldo. Jar sheds a tear for Costaldo, because he is dead and can't teach him anything.

They hear a scream of terror. They run, end up in a clearing and there is nothing there, but they here something in the undergrowth... multiple somethings.

Spark throws a fluffy balls to the ground and a lions joins the group. Jar uses the latern of revealing, doesnÂ´t see anything in particular.

There are 4 Crag Cats that get killed by the party. After they discovered 4 tiny Kitten Crag Cats. Vyth, Morn, Kaos and Spark all "adopt" one.

Jar is angry at Morn because he his more okay with Spark than Vyth, even though they are both constructs.

They did loose the scent and tracks of Tiny Tom and Fionnlagh. They argue about sending Fionnlagh a message, but decide not to. Spark gives Morn Owls wisdom by making him look into the skull of Costaldo. Morn tries to find the track again. He sees something and follows it.

They see Little Tom sitting against a tree, tired and cold. Jar gives him a heath sack and they warmth of Gond.
He says he was looking for his Father and seems really happy when Morn said his Father is looking for him. Little Tom thinks Fionnleigh is really smart and cool and can definitly help him. Kaos carries him back home and Morn explains death. Spark whispers with Kaos about the possibility of reanimating the Father.

Kaos makes Little Tom fall asleep whilst there is still some confusion on Morns part about the Father and the Dead.

Spark sends the lion away to explorer, he will dissapear by dawn.

The guard tells them about Fionnlagh being back. Jar gives him two gold coins. Spark covers his warhammer with a bag.

They go to Big Tom's house and hand him Little Tom. Morn explains what happened and the fact that he needed to talk about death with his son. Jar hands him the Crag Cat from Spark as a pet for Little Tom. Morn checks what they need some milk. Big Tom kinda lets them know he needs them to leave. Spark offers to improve his tools. Jar gives him three gold coins, without him noticing.

Kaos tries to carry Spark. Daero is behind the bar. Kaos ask if she can bring in a friend. The rest is finding a place to sleep

Morn knocks on Fionnlagh door. Fionnlagh is irritated. Morn explains. Fionnlagh doesn't take accountability for his cult or the kid, thinks the dad should take care of the kid. 

Jar gives Vyths Crag Cat to Kaos and commands Vyth to guard Kaos. Jar goes to a bed. Kaos falls asleep at the table and Daero gives her a blanket.
