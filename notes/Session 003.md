# Session 003

The adventurers navigate the icy tunnels beneath the [Crystal Desert](./Crystal Desert.md), and manage to avoid the skittering of nearby [Rhemorhaz](./Rhemorhaz.md)’s. They find a hollow out area in the ice containing a nest of broken eggs, but soon move on from the area, following [Morn](./Morn.md)’s lead. Morn senses [Helm](./Helm.md)’s presence guiding him through the tunnels, and leads his companions to a metal door. The door is marked with black stones shaped like the different phases of the moon. 

They touch the door, and the stones emit a dazzling white light. The frozen dials around it move. They realize they must solve the puzzle before the door will open. Two Rhemorhaz’s are drawn to something, perhaps the noise, and attack the group. Morn falls in battle, but they manage to defeat the creatures with a cleverly placed grease spell. Morn is dragged to safety by [Algernon](./Algernon.md).

They finally unlock the door and climb a metal ladder, entering a large chamber. Inside they find a massive mechanical structure that they later realize resembles a body, with gold chains dangling where a large portion of the top has been torn aside, revealing daylight above. In the centre of the structure is a pulsing crystal. It seems part of the structure is off kilter, and needs repairing. 

An argument ensues between party members as [Fionnlagh](./Fionnlagh.md) insists they repair the broken structure, while Algernon firmly disagrees. Insults are hurled, and [Smushey](./Smushey.md) pointedly ignores everyone. While arguing, they discover a white dragon scale, and [Jar](./Jar) panics. The dragonborn insists they leave immediately, and with the adventurers all unsure of their next plans, the party splits.

Jar and Fionnlagh climb to the opening and look out to see an expansive ocean dotted with icebergs, and a white storm swirling in the distance. The rest of the adventurers return through the tunnels with [Alfred the Ox](./Alfred the Ox.md) in tow, and they all meet back at the edge of the ravine. After some clever rope and spell usage, they manage to bring the beast and the rest back to the surface.

The adventurers make their return trek to [Emberhold](./Emberhold.md). On their journey, another piercing light bursts from the glacier where they had left. Their task is yet incomplete. When they return to Emberhold, Morn immediately sets to work on a small shrine dedicated to Alfred the heroic Ox.
