# Session 016

Harper sends the party after the dragon. Morn gets some diamonds from Harper (just in case). They sail up the coast and search for the kobolds. They expect an ambush so the group splits up on the shore and keeps watch.

They observe a meteor shower at night. 

The next morning, Morn feels uneasy with the area. They find an old, frozen camp. The kobolds never show, so they debate if they should go to the village. Jar is hesitant. They eventually decide to postpone their encounter with the dragon, and return to Emberhold. 

Harper and the rest are surprised to see them back so soon. Jar explains that they’re going to explore the tunnels below Emberhold. The people of the outpost may have to use them to escape in case the dragon appears and attacks. Jar leaves a ring with Algernon and tells him to use his telescope to keep an eye on the skies for dragons. Algernon grumbles about the task but agrees to stay on watch.

In the tunnels, they are hit with ocean water before turning and make a winding descent through the tunnels. They climb to an ancient, upside-down door and break the door open to reveal a long corridor and two wizard statues (also upside-down). Everything is made of the same black stone as they’ve seen on the sphere in the centre of Emberhold. 

They discover a library scattered with piles of books written in ancient scripts. A hole in the ground reveals an old laboratory and they can hear skittering. Morn spots four or five Remorhaz below. They see a metal chest bolted to the ceiling and locked, and still have more of the upside-down wizard’s tower to explore in the ice beneath Emberhold.
