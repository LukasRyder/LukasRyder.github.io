# Session 005

The adventurers speak with the underwater beast that attacked [Emberhold](./Emberhold.md)’s fishermen, and discover that it is a [plesiosaurus](./Plesiosaurus.md) with the unique and rather un-animal-like ability to speak. It asks for fish, and after some negotiation, decides that it enjoys the easy fishing it finds in the [Broken Ice Bay](./Broken Ice Bay.md), but is unsure how long it will stick around. 

The plesiosaurus explores underwater caves beneath Emberhold after some coaxing from the group. [Jar](./Jar.md) suggests they name the beast “Scruffy” since he has no name.

They return to Emberhold and discover the group of lumberjacks have returned from the Chillwind Forest without [Smushey](./Smushey.md). They claim he left tracks into the woods, but they dared not follow him out too far. 

In the morning, Jar offers gifts to his companions, and then they all head Northwards into the forest in search of their dwarven friend. Their new druid friend, [Koda](./Koda.md), uses her tracking skills to help them follow Smushey’s trail, and she also finds moose tracks going in the same direction. 

They then follow some bobbing lights and find themselves in an open clearing with a [single, massive tree](./TTree Of Dolls.md) in the centre. Upon the tree they find small twig constructions hanging there, and discover they are dolls. Jar inspects one of the dolls and finds it closely resembles their friend Smushey. And, it is warm to the touch and pulsing. [Fionnlagh](./Fionnlagh.md) doesn´t trust the weird dolls and runs back into the forrest.

The tree’s root wraps around Jar’s leg, and the adventurers spring into action as the massive tree groans into movement.
