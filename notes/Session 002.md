# Session 002

After a harrowing fight against the beetles, the Adventurer’s are thanked by [Harper](./Harper.md) and the other residents of [Emberhold](./Emberhold.md). They are given their lodgings, and [Jar](./Jar.md) makes an inventive, albeit muddy, jacuzzi in the snow. [Fionnlagh](./Fionnlagh.md) and [Morn](./Morn.md) find a room in the inn’s upper floors, while [Smushey](./Smushey.md) and Jar settle into some of the one-room huts in the worker’s dwellings. 
The night passes. The Adventurers have discussions with Harper, [Daero](./Daero.md) and [Arcturis](./Arcturis.md). Morn questions them after hearing them discuss “the source”, and Harper gives Morn a mission for his group: find the source, and stop these insect attacks. 

[Algernon](./Algernon.md) scolds Arcturis for his carelessness outside, and the young mage stomps away angrily. Fionnlagh examines the strange sac found in the [centipede](./Rhemorhaz.md) and discovers it is a thermal vesicle of some sort, and thinks that if he were to combine it with another magical substance, he may be able to create a useful potion. Algernon sets up the beginnings of his observatory in the top of Witreach tower and spends the early mornings charting the stars.

After some quick prayers, weather forecasting and preparation,the party sets out on their journey with Alfred the Ox in tow. They travel across stretching grasslands and rocky terrain, each with their individual duties of navigating, foraging and scouting. On the second day, Morn spots an elk carcass and sees wolves in the distance. That night, they make camp and Jar offers his jacuzzi to the party.

While everyone is enjoying the bubbles, the wolves circle their camp and attack. Smushey jumps between Algernon and the wolves and is nearly taken down. Algernon defends the dwarf with his staff, and manages to kill one of the wolves. The others shoot arrows and fire and the wolves flee to find an easier meal elsewhere. 

The next day, they reach the expanse of the [Crystal Deserts](./Crystal Desert.md), and cross broken plateaus of ice. Eventually, they find a break in the ice not easily crossed, and decide to go into the tunnels below. Fionnlagh scouts ahead and Jar shoves the party into the tunnels with his custom parachutes. Smushey and Algernon reluctantly go below the ice with the rest. 

As the cold, stale air hits them in the tunnels below, the Adventurer’s and their ox begin their walk through the twisting, icy maze to gods-know-where.
