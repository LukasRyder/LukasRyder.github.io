# Session 029

We are going to the ship. Spark, Chaos and Jar are going down to the ship protected against the cold and with something making them able to breath.

Morn and Fionn have a discussion about why Fionn looks different. Fionn knows, but says he doesn´t. Morn isn´t sure if he tells the truth, but does offer advice about shaving and a coming of age ceremony for after this part of the adventure.

Found tablets with Dwarvish runes: 
- Found Ostorian Chisel 
- Nildar disobaying orders, making the right choice and destroying this thing. 
- Huge mistake, many dead, fleeing.

Jar adds
- Can confirm. Many died, Jar and a drawing of a dick

Anything made with a tool this special hold value to Sparks people, he wants to find the things.

Something in the room is constantly pumping air into the room as there is a steady stream and the room is free of water.

In one of the rooms is a crystal hanging on golden chains with golden light around it
In one of the rooms are bunks
In one of the rooms is a kitchen and food supplies, a carving staging and something Spark doesn´t recognise a series of little bird cages d20 shaped with runes and a liquid that is cristalised everywhere it spilled

Jar goes into the room with the crystal and takes lightning damage. Jar sees a deep dark room with huge colums and dwarves with the same skin colour as dur  working on in a forge. All the walls in the vision have mushrooms growing all over. Jar and Chaos discuss that his vision is different as hers. There is a small crack in the crystal.

Chaos uses her javelin of lightning and the lightning from the crystal arcs over and keeps sparking between the javelin and the crystal. Spark uses a mending cantrip whilst the lighting is distracted. 

Chaos tests if the crystal is now stable and she takes a lot of lightning damage and she feels a little tremor inside her core. Jar touches the chains and also takes some lightning damage.

They discuss how to take the crystal and the chisel. The chisel goes through a hole in the hull and gets down to the bottom of the lake. Jar wraps his magic rope around it. 

Fionn hears the banging on from the chisel and concludes that they are probably still alive.

Jar and Spark try to wrap cap of waterbreathing around the crystal and use a javelin to hold it around. They break one chain. The lighting sparks from the broken chain to the javelin. Chaos mage hands the chain that is coming from the crystal around the javelin, now it is "safe"

Chaos breaks through with the chisel and ties the magic rope. Jar breaks the chain and they get the They break another chain and all the lights go out and water streams in a lot. They get out and go back to the rope and pull themselves up again.

When the people get out of the water Fionn steps back afraid of getting wet. Morn refuses to handle the javelin Jar is swinging around.

They all warm up and Vyth is walking around spewing flames into the air and melting the ice under him a little.

Fionn hears two voices
