# Session 001


The adventurers all found themselves at the bustling Orkpork docks at dawn, where three of the five travelled together to the door of the Grand Venture Co. They were admitted inside the warehouse, and after quickly signing some contracts while waiting for their departure, the adventurers were ushered into the basement where a teleportation circle awaited. 

After some coaxing of [Alfred the Ox](./Alfred the Ox.md) onto the magical circle, the adventurers were sent through the portal to a cold stone tower amidst a blizzarding storm.

They were hurriedly welcomed to [Emberhold](./Emberhold.md) by [Harper Indigo](./Harper.md), an armoured human woman. [Fionnlagh](./Fionnlagh.md) curiously checked the crates of supplies before they were all carted through the storm. 

In the centre of Emberhold, the adventurers saw a strange, massive black sphere of an unknown material, radiating warmth. A young man named [Arcturis](./Arcturis.md) stood on the platform near this sphere and made notes on it, before being ushered inside by Harper. 

The adventurers huddled into the [Elemental Fundamentals](./Elemental Fundamentals.md), a cozy inn, tavern and store. They were greeted by [Daero](./Daero.md), a thick muscled, white-furred Firbolg with a friendly attitude.

[Algernon](./Algernon.md), the somewhat grumpy old human wizard, noticed a distant flash of light through the blizzard while looking through the window. Arcturis suddenly gathered up his papers and burst into the storm after a sudden, unspoken revelation. [Jar](./Jar.md) watched the man go out into the storm, and noticed he did not intend to return to his tower. 

A rumble shook the ground moments later, and through the storm burst a dozen small, [many-legged insectoid creatures](./Rhemorhaz.md) emanating heat from their forms. Harper ran to wake the guards of Emberhold, while [Daero](./Daero.md) drew a crossbow and aided the adventurers in the fight. Alfred the Ox looked uncomfortable, but sat quietly in the corner.
[Smushey](./Smushey.md) burst through a large window and charged into the fight with his massive shield warding off the creatures' every attack. 

In the snow, the adventurers dispatched the insects and found a larger, blue centipede that seemed to be an older sibling to the other creatures. They found Arcturis, beaten almost to unconsciousness, before [Morn](./Morn.md) dealt the final, deadly blow on the largest creature. Fionnlagh quickly extracted strange, heat-pulsing energy sacs from within the centipede and packed them away for later study. 
Harper emerged and congratulated the adventurers and they returned to the inn to sort out their living spaces. Harper and Daero explained these attacks had been happening only in the last couple of days, and told the adventurers that their first task would be to find out why.

As the blizzard finally let up, the adventurers looked out at the fresh blanket of snow covering the now calm village of Emberhold, with their first task still ahead of them.
